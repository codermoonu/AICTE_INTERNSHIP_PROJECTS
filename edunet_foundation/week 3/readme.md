## üîç Overview

The goal of this project is to predict multiple parameters of water quality‚Äîsuch as pH, hardness, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and conductivity‚Äîusing a supervised machine learning approach. It aims to provide a scalable, low-cost alternative to manual testing, suitable for real-time environmental monitoring systems.

---

## üß© Problem Statement

Manual water testing is often slow, resource-intensive, and limited in scale. There is a need for an intelligent system that can analyze environmental data and predict various quality parameters quickly and accurately to support public health, industrial safety, and ecological conservation.

## üí° Solution

A `MultiOutputRegressor` wrapped around a `RandomForestRegressor` was implemented to predict multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This model was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships.

Key features:
- Multi-parameter prediction
- Scalable and reproducible workflow
- Evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤ score
